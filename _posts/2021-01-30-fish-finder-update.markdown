This new kayak came with its own new toy: a fish finder! I'm really excited to use this so I can get a better feel for what I'm fishing in.

I spent some time on this rainy day updating the software and downloading some of the Social Maps from C-Maps. I'm hoping this helps me find spots and analyze my current ones better. I can feel a few things through the line, but finding things away from the bank is going to be a whole new element!

My first outing, I plan to hit a some spots where I've had success. I want to see what makes those places good and then start looking for more like that.
