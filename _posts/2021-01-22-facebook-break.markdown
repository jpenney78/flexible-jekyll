I put myself in Facebook jail. I don't know how long this will last, but it needed to be done.

Technology and the access to information should be such a great thing for us. Unfortunately, the popular use of it is the opposite. Maybe it's just my feed. Maybe it's just what I end up getting suckered into. It seems every conversation gets to some dogmatic argument.

But I punch on, looking up facts. Trying to show the data I'm working from. Then the name calling starts. The call out to non-existent boogey men. Fear. Plain an simple.

This word is scary. These people are scary. Those people are after you. So much paranoia. Total lack of information.

I feel like I go in willing to listen. Change my mind, really. Show me real things. Show me real data. Show me a pattern. Show me something consistent. I don't want to be right about everything now, I want to continue being more accurate.
