I've had some feedback that I don't have quantifiable goals, which is true for quite a few of these items. That's how I want it. Clearly some are concrete (and some I've already done), but the others need to be fuzzy for me to do it.

My entire work life is measured or measuring some goal. It's distilling data from multiple sources, learning how it relates to the real world, and spitting out a number to make it make sense. I don't want that for my personal life.

And that's it! I'll come back and strikethrough the ones that are done.
