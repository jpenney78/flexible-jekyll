Facebook is no longer on my phone, and my account is deactivated. It's a huge relief.

I'm really trying to focus on positive things and put positive energy into the world and Facebook was simply getting in my way. I couldn't take anymore of the hatred and attacks. People, who are friends in person, that would devolve into a fit of name calling. I'm done with that crap.

Even moving back to a blog was tainted. My first attempted posts were just carryover from the horrible experience I'd been having on Facebook. And maybe this post is too, but I've got to get it out and this is my outlet.

I'm not off of social media entirely. And I'm still using Instagram, but that tone there is something totally different. A friend, whom I talk to regularly doens't follow me on Facebook (and hasn't for a while) because he couldn't stand the comments on my posts. He still follows me on Instagram. That's some confirmation that Facebook posts were shown to people in a way that would get engagement, but it was a lot of the wrong kind.

I'm sure I'll be back. Heck, I've logged in a couple times to look at specific things on Marketplace or a specific page. But I'm done letting it be a major conduit for communication and relationships in my life.
