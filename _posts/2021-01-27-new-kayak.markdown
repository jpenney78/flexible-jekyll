I've really enjoyed kayak fishing, but I haven't really liked the kayak I have. I got a great deal on it, but it's not really a good kayak. (An Ascend FS10T, for anyone interested.)

Yesterday, I was helping a friend look for bass boats on Facebook Marketplace and dropped in "kayak" just to see what the market was looking like. The first result was this kayak, a 3 Waters Big Fish 120 that already had lots of upgrades.

The kayak was listed for a pretty good price, but excluded a few of the things in the pictures. He said they were negotiable, so we negotiated.

It ended up being just about perfect for my needs. It's big, stable (reportedly), and has all of the upgrades that I would have purchased for any kayak that I ended up with. All below the budget that I had set for myself!

## Details

- 3 Waters Big Fish 120 - 12' Sit on top fishing kayak
  - Multi position seat (which is awesome)
  - Rod holders
  - Pod for a transducer
  - Storage cubbies and LOTS of deck space
- Anchor trolley
- Anchor Wizard
- Rudder kit installed
- Lowrance Hook2 7 installed on the pod
- Transducer mounted on the bottom of the pod

Never been on the water. I can't wait to get it out to see how she feels! Which, if the weather holds as predicted, should be some time on Saturday.
