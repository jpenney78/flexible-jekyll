Low information has become a badge of pride.

Today, a woman (not wearing a mask) started talking to Mary about her whole life. She’s an anti-vaxxer, doesn’t believe in drugs, homeschooled her kids until she just "couldn't be there anymore" and put them in a church school. Why she needed to share this with us as we passed through Wal-Mart ... I'l never know.

She then went on an on about “all these kids” she knows that went completely non-communicative after getting a tetanus shot.  In the town we live in. Multiple kids, that somehow never made the news or even the local gossip groups on Nextdoor or Facebook. I would assume in a town of ~50,000 that we'd hear about a big outbreak of pre-teen kids in this state.

Then I have a conversation with someone close to me. She brings up something she saw about 10 people in Germany dying after getting the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. I do a quick search, and don’t see anything. Even close to that. I then ask, “you said it was a news paper, was it like a photo of a newspaper looking site?”

“Yes. But it figures that it wouldn’t be on the media. They just lie.”

So all of the news sites, papers, tv stations are lying, but this one grainy photo of a German news site (that can’t be found) is the true media. And even if it could be found, doesn't it being a newspaper make it the media?

I’ve seen multiple disinformation campaigns use this tactic. I can’t even understand how any faith gets put in something  like that. How does someone even take a grainy picture with today’s cameras? Why wouldn’t you send a screenshot? Or, even better, a link? And WHY does anyone believe this crap.

I realize that 2020 has been a hard year. But further buying into disinformation isn't going to actually change anything. We can't fight a disease by pretending it isn't real. We can't change democracy by pretending it's not real. We've got to start from a place of truth.
